    - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies.
    - Our models take past stock, crypto, and forex prices to predict future trends.
    - We normalize the data, pass it through LSTM layers, and optimize using Adam optimizer.

    - Data is collected from various financial sources and consists of historical prices of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex pairs.
